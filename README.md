# Amazon Webpage Clone
First repository

Author: Shreeya Smita Mohanty


I've recently crafted a webpage that mirrors the design of Amazon, utilizing HTML and CSS for the front-end development. It's been an engaging exercise in applying programming languages to recreate a familiar interface.
It's worth mentioning, though, that while this endeavor is a great way to hone web development skills, it's crucial to uphold ethical standards. Respecting intellectual property rights is essential, and it's advised to steer clear of any unethical or illegal activities.

Feel free to use the provided files (index.html and style.css) and open them in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or coding software application.
